  - [x] Best score never updated from faulty results
  - [x] Clear console output showing status

## User-Facing Output

- [x] **Console Display**
  - [x] Status column shows ✓ Valid or ❌ FAULTY
  - [x] Faulty reason included in output
  - [x] Faulty iteration summary at end
  - [x] Clear indication of which iterations contributed to best score

- [x] **Progress File**
  - [x] Each iteration includes `faulty` flag
  - [x] Faulty iterations show `fault_reason`
  - [x] Progress file always updated correctly

- [x] **Logging**

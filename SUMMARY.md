## 🗺️ The OptiConn Pipeline (Visual)

### Shortest Possible Explanation

```
User runs: opticonn sweep

Calls (in order):
1. opticonn_hub.py           ← Entry point
2. validate_setup.py         ← Check system
3. cross_validation_bootstrap_optimizer.py  ← Sweep engine
   - Uses: sweep_utils.py    ← Grid generation
   - For each combo, calls:
4. run_pipeline.py           ← Single extraction
   ├─ extract_connectivity_matrices.py     ← DSI Studio
   ├─ aggregate_network_measures.py        ← Metrics
   ├─ qa_cross_validator.py                ← Validation (prevent bugs)
   └─ bootstrap_qa_validator.py            ← Anomaly detection (prevent bugs)

Result: combo_diagnostics.csv with all parameter combos scored & validated
```

### More Detail (What Each Script Category Does)

```
ENTRY POINT (1 script)
  └─ opticonn_hub.py         Parse CLI, route commands

CORE PIPELINE (6 scripts - always used)
  ├─ run_pipeline.py         Execute single extraction
  ├─ extract_connectivity_matrices.py    Extract connectivity
  ├─ aggregate_network_measures.py       Compute metrics  
  ├─ qa_cross_validator.py   Validation (+ prevention L1&L2)
  └─ bootstrap_qa_validator.py    Anomaly detection (+ prevention L3)

SWEEP-SPECIFIC (2 scripts - only if doing sweeps)
  ├─ cross_validation_bootstrap_optimizer.py   Sweep orchestration
  └─ sweep_utils.py          Grid/sampling utilities

OPTIONAL (validation, debug)
  ├─ validate_setup.py
  ├─ pre_test_validation.py
  └─ ... more

RESEARCH (7+ scripts - safe to remove)
  ├─ pareto_view.py
  ├─ sensitivity_analyzer.py
  ├─ statistical_analysis.py
  └─ ... more
```

## 🚀 Quick Navigation Guide

### "I need to understand the pipeline NOW"
```
1. Open: SCRIPTS_SUMMARY.md (read tables)
2. Run: MINIMAL_DEMO.md option 1 (takes 1 min)
3. Look at: SWEEP_WORKFLOW.md (trace actual flow)
Done! You understand it all.
```

### "I'm modifying a script, what calls it?"
```
1. Open: SCRIPT_REFERENCE.md
2. Find: Your script in the dependency tree
3. See: What calls it and what it calls
Done!
```

### "Can I delete script X?"
```
1. Open: CLEANUP_GUIDE.md
2. Find: Your script in the tables
3. See: If it's safe/unsafe
Done!
```

### "Show me everything step-by-step"
```
1. Read: SWEEP_WORKFLOW.md (full diagram)

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps (Choose One)

### Option A: Run the Demo
```bash
cd /data/local/software/braingraph-pipeline
source braingraph_pipeline/bin/activate
python opticonn.py sweep -i /your/test/data -o /tmp/demo --quick --subjects 1 --no-emoji
```
**Time**: 1-5 minutes  
**Gain**: See actual sweep in action  
**Reference**: MINIMAL_DEMO.md

### Option B: Clean Up the Code
```bash
# Read CLEANUP_GUIDE.md, decide what to remove, then:
rm scripts/pareto_view.py scripts/run_parameter_sweep.py scripts/sensitivity_analyzer.py ...
```
**Time**: 10 minutes  
**Gain**: Simpler codebase (25% less code)  
**Reference**: CLEANUP_GUIDE.md

### Option C: Study the Architecture
```bash
# Read the documentation to understand design
# Review SWEEP_WORKFLOW.md → SCRIPT_REFERENCE.md
```
**Time**: 30 minutes  
**Gain**: Deep understanding of system  
**Reference**: SWEEP_WORKFLOW.md + SCRIPT_REFERENCE.md

### Option D: Leave It As Is
```bash
# Documentation is in place for future reference
# Core pipeline is clean and working
# Prevention system automatically active
# You can refer to docs when needed
```
**Time**: 0 minutes (immediate)  
**Gain**: Zero risk, full clarity available when needed  
**Reference**: DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md (to find docs later)

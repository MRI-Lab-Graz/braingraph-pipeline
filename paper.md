## Summary

Structural connectome construction depends on numerous interlocking choices (atlas, tracking parameters, streamline count, connectivity threshold, metric). These are often fixed heuristically, reducing reproducibility and risking biased network structure. *OptiConn* (the optimization layer inside `braingraph-pipeline`) provides a fully automated, data-driven workflow that (i) performs a systematic parameter sweep (grid, random, or Latin hypercube sampling), (ii) evaluates candidate configurations via global graph-theoretic measures, (iii) applies a two-wave cross-validation procedure on independently sampled subject subsets to mitigate overfitting, and (iv) produces a ranked shortlist (Top‑3) of robust atlas–metric–parameter combinations. Selection uses an absolute-scale composite score (quality_score_raw) with a tract_count tie‑breaker for near‑ties. The framework supports parallel execution, optional pruning of non‑selected runs, and emits machine‑readable artifacts (per‑wave `selected_parameters.json`, cross‑wave `top3_candidates.json`, `all_candidates_ranked.json`). A selected configuration is then applied uniformly to the full cohort, yielding study-specific, reproducible structural connectomes.

## Statement of need

There is no consensus “best” parameterization for diffusion tractography–based connectomics; different atlases and thresholds materially shift graph topology. Existing pipelines (e.g. generic MRtrix or DIPY scripts) provide flexible building blocks but little built-in guidance for principled parameter selection. *OptiConn* reframes methodological setup as an explicit optimization problem isolated from downstream hypothesis testing, reducing circularity and encouraging reproducible, study-tailored configurations.

## State of the field

Foundational graph metrics for brain networks are well established [@Rubinov2010]. Tool ecosystems (MRtrix3, DIPY, networkx-based wrappers) enable tract generation and graph computation, but integrate limited automated parameter ranking. Some recent works explore reliability screens or density control, yet few implement (1) multi-parameter sweeps, (2) independent bootstrap-like validation waves, and (3) composite scoring across normalized global metrics in a single cohesive, reproducible workflow. *OptiConn* targets that gap.

## Design and implementation

Core components:

1. **Parameter sweep engine**: User-declared ranges (list or `start:step:end` syntax) for tractography (e.g. FA/Otsu thresholds, min/max length, streamline count, turning angle, smoothing) and connectivity (atlas set, metric: count/qa/fa, connectivity threshold, type). Sampling modes: exhaustive grid, random, Latin hypercube; optional “quick sweep” for coarse pruning.
2. **Two-wave cross-validation**: Two independent random subject subsets (Wave 1, Wave 2) run the identical sweep; scores are aggregated (mean or robust statistic) to dampen overfitting to a single sample.
3. **Graph metric acquisition**: For each candidate (atlas × metric × parameter set) global measures are extracted (density, global efficiency [weighted], small‑worldness, clustering/transitivity, path length, assortativity, rich‑club indices; optionally diameter, radius, modularity). Aggregators collate per‑atlas CSVs into wave‑level tables for scoring.
4. **Scoring framework**: Component scores are combined into an absolute‑scale composite in [0,1] per component weight, producing `quality_score_raw`. For visualization and per‑run plots, a within‑run normalized `quality_score` is also provided but not used for selection. Weights and acceptable corridors (e.g., small‑worldness) are configurable; optional quantile clipping reduces outlier leverage.
5. **Ranking & selection**: Candidates are ranked by the mean `quality_score_raw` across the evaluation subset. Ties are broken by lower streamline count (`tract_count`) to favor computational efficiency. Artifacts include per‑wave `selected_parameters.json` and cross‑wave `optimization_results/top3_candidates.json` plus `optimization_results/all_candidates_ranked.json`.
6. **Automation & performance**: Single high-level commands: `optimize` (sweep → waves → aggregation) and `apply`/`analyze` (full-cohort extraction with chosen configuration). Parallel execution per wave is supported via `--max-parallel`; per‑combo thread allocation can be auto‑scaled. Non‑selected combo outputs can be pruned (`--prune-nonbest`). Optional conversion steps (e.g., connectogram CSVs) can be toggled to save I/O; large intermediates (e.g., `.tt.gz`) can be cleaned up.
7. **Reproducibility & hygiene**: Deterministic seeds, config echoing and parameter snapshots for Step‑01, machine‑readable artifacts, and clear logging. Robust path resolution for bundled scripts and consistent interpreter use (project virtual environment) reduce environment drift.

## Quality control

Validation measures:

- **Cross-wave stability**: Score divergence between waves flags fragile candidates; the cross‑wave aggregator reports ranked candidates with stability metadata.
- **Density corridor**: Reject extreme sparsity or saturation early.
- **Absolute vs. normalized clarity**: Selection uses absolute `quality_score_raw` (mean across subjects), avoiding deceptive identical maxima that can occur with within‑run normalization; normalized `quality_score` is retained for plots only.
- **Diagnostics**: Per‑combo logs include `raw_mean`, `tract_count`, and summary network measures (`density_mean`, `geff_w_mean`) to aid interpretability.
- **Diagnostics (persisted)**: Each sweep combination now writes a `diagnostics.json` plus a wave‑level `combo_diagnostics.csv` summarizing parameters, scores, and key measures for meta‑analysis and replication.
- **Determinism**: Re-running with identical seeds reproduces Top‑3 ordering (empirically verified in internal tests).
- **Transparent selection**: Human choice occurs only after unbiased ranking; no group labels used during optimization.


## Reuse potential

The toolkit enables:

- Rapid study-specific optimization for new cohorts.
- Method harmonization across centers by sharing final JSON configs.
- Benchmarking of atlases or connectivity metrics under standardized scoring.
- Extension via plugin scorers (planned) to incorporate reliability or modularity stability.
Outputs (ranked candidates, final matrices, metrics) integrate with downstream statistical frameworks or machine learning pipelines.

## Limitations

- **Compute cost**: Large grids can be expensive; mitigated by sampling modes, quick sweeps, parallelism, and pruning of non‑selected runs.
- **Global metric focus**: Edge-level or community stability not yet part of core score (planned).
- **Two-wave design**: Improves robustness but does not fully eliminate overfitting in very small datasets.
- **Normalized score interpretability**: Within‑run normalization can yield identical maxima by design; selection therefore uses absolute `quality_score_raw`.
- **No clinical outcome optimization**: Intentional separation to avoid leakage; downstream modeling remains user responsibility.

## Roadmap (selected)

Near‑term (minor releases):
 
- Edge reliability bootstrapping: resample streamlines/thresholds and report edge‑wise ICC/CI heatmaps; optional reliability‑aware masking to stabilize downstream stats.
- Pareto multi‑objective front: rank candidates on a front spanning quality_score_raw, density corridor deviation, and compute cost (tract_count), with knee‑point guidance instead of a single scalar.
- Bayesian adaptive re‑sampling: allocate sweep budget to promising regions via BO/GP on discrete grids; early stopping for clearly sub‑optimal areas.
- Provenance hashing: content‑addressed hashes of config + dataset manifest + environment (Python, OS) + DSI Studio/Git versions, embedded in filenames and artifacts.
- Plugin‑based scorers: a minimal scorer API to add criteria (e.g., test–retest ICC, prediction utility), with weights and guardrails defined in config.
- Persisted per‑combo diagnostics (CSV/JSON): structured schema capturing run stats, global measures, and selection features for meta‑analysis and replication.
- Modularity stability metrics: consensus clustering / variation‑of‑information across bootstraps as an optional scorer.
- Normative reference integration: score deviations from reference distributions (e.g., HCP/NKI) per atlas/metric to flag atypical topology.

 
 
Mid‑term (research directions):

- Cross‑site harmonization: site‑aware CV and ComBat/GAM adjustments to reduce acquisition bias before scoring.
- Uncertainty reporting: propagate subject‑level dispersion to candidate‑level CIs; display whiskers alongside means in reports.
- Reproducible environments: container images and lockfiles for one‑command reproduction on Linux/macOS clusters.
- Cost/energy awareness: track runtime and resource usage per combo to enable cost‑aware selection on constrained budgets.
- Public benchmarks: curated datasets and leaderboards to compare atlas/metric families under standardized scoring.

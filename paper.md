# Summary

`braingraph-pipeline` is an open-source Python toolkit designed for the analysis and processing of brain connectivity data. It provides a modular pipeline for extracting, validating, and analyzing brain graphs from neuroimaging datasets. The toolkit supports workflows for quality assurance, statistical analysis, and optimization of connectivity measures, making it suitable for both research and clinical applications.

# Statement of need

The analysis of brain connectivity is a key aspect of modern neuroscience. Existing tools often lack flexibility, reproducibility, or integration with quality assurance workflows. `braingraph-pipeline` addresses these needs by providing a configurable, scriptable, and extensible platform for brain graph analysis, supporting both batch and individual processing.

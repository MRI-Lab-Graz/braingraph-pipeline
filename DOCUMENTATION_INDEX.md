## Quick Navigation

### üéØ "I want to understand the whole pipeline"
‚Üí Start with **`SWEEP_WORKFLOW.md`** (complete flow diagram)  
‚Üí Then **`SCRIPT_REFERENCE.md`** (which scripts do what)

### üß™ "I want to run a demo to see it in action"
‚Üí Go to **`MINIMAL_DEMO.md`** (step-by-step guide)  
‚Üí Includes 3 options: ultra-fast, minimal, or single combo

### üóëÔ∏è "I want to clean up unused scripts"
‚Üí Read **`CLEANUP_GUIDE.md`** (decision framework)  
‚Üí Tells you what's safe to remove

### üìã "I just need a quick reference"
‚Üí Use **`SCRIPTS_SUMMARY.md`** (one-page summary)

### ‚≠ê "I want to understand the prevention system"
‚Üí Check **`PREVENTION_SYSTEM.md`** (3-layer validation details)  
*(If file exists in repo)*

**Read when**: You need to understand what calls what

---

### 3. **MINIMAL_DEMO.md**
**Purpose**: Step-by-step guide to run a tiny sweep and understand each phase  
**Contains**:
- 3 demo options (30-sec, 1-min, single-combo)
- What to look for in output
- Script flow chart
- Troubleshooting
- Analysis of results

**Read when**: You want hands-on understanding (actually run code)

---

### 4. **SCRIPTS_SUMMARY.md**
**Purpose**: One-page quick reference card  
**Contains**:
- Core scripts table
- Sweep-specific scripts
- What you actually use (based on goal)
- Prevention system summary
- Safe to delete list

**Read when**: You need quick lookup

---

### 5. **CLEANUP_GUIDE.md**
**Purpose**: Decision framework for removing unused scripts  
**Contains**:
- 4-tier cleanup recommendations
- Decision questions (Do you run sweeps? Do you need analysis?)
- Safe removal commands
- Rollback plan
- Before/after codebase structure

**Read when**: You want to simplify the codebase

## How to Use This Documentation

### Scenario 1: "The code is too complicated, where do I start?"

```
1. Read: SCRIPTS_SUMMARY.md (5 min)
   ‚Üí Get overview of what scripts exist
   
2. Run: MINIMAL_DEMO.md option 1 (1 min)
   ‚Üí See the pipeline in action
   
3. Review: SWEEP_WORKFLOW.md (10 min)
   ‚Üí Understand how scripts connect
   
4. Check: CLEANUP_GUIDE.md (5 min)
   ‚Üí Know what you can safely remove
```

**Total time**: ~20 minutes to understand everything

---

### Scenario 2: "I want to modify the pipeline"

```
1. Read: SCRIPT_REFERENCE.md
   ‚Üí Find which script handles your concern
   
2. Review: SWEEP_WORKFLOW.md
   ‚Üí See how it's called and what calls it
   
3. Check: Cross-references in code
   ‚Üí Use grep to find all usages
```

---

### Scenario 3: "The codebase is messy, let me clean it up"

```
1. Read: CLEANUP_GUIDE.md
   ‚Üí Understand safe/unsafe removals
   
2. Answer: Decision questions
   ‚Üí Do I run sweeps? Do I need analysis tools?
   
3. Execute: Cleanup script (with backup!)
   ‚Üí Remove tier 1 scripts
   
4. Verify: Test main commands still work
   ‚Üí opticonn sweep, opticonn apply, opticonn pipeline
```

## Key Insights

### üéØ Core Pipeline is Small
Only **6 essential scripts** are always needed:
- `opticonn_hub.py`, `run_pipeline.py`, `extract_connectivity_matrices.py`
- `aggregate_network_measures.py`, `qa_cross_validator.py`, `bootstrap_qa_validator.py`

### üß™ Sweep Adds 2 Scripts
If you do parameter sweeps, add:
- `cross_validation_bootstrap_optimizer.py`, `sweep_utils.py`

### üî¨ Research Tools Are Optional
7+ scripts for analysis/research can be removed without affecting pipeline:
- `pareto_view.py`, `sensitivity_analyzer.py`, `statistical_analysis.py`, etc.

### ‚≠ê Prevention System is Automatic
3-layer validation runs automatically in all workflows:
- Layer 1 & 2: `qa_cross_validator.py` (during extraction)
- Layer 3: `bootstrap_qa_validator.py` (post-sweep)

No extra scripts needed!

## Future Maintenance

As you add features, use this structure:

1. **Document the flow** in SWEEP_WORKFLOW.md style
2. **Create a decision tree** in SCRIPT_REFERENCE.md style
3. **Add a demo** to MINIMAL_DEMO.md if needed
4. **Update SCRIPTS_SUMMARY.md** with new tables
5. **Update CLEANUP_GUIDE.md** if safe removals change
